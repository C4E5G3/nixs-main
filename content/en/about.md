# Hey, I am Marcus ${surname}

I am a British writer, which is why I have a blog in English, who resides in France.
When I've written my 'Year In Provence', I'll let you know.... 
I really live to write in a sense, as creating things is my main thing in life.
The blog is a place to get some ideas in print. The bible studies are a way to clean up 
the eschatalogical mess left over the last 200 years, (and beyond), by some well-meaning 
and some less well-meaning people...and some real crazies who have infiltrated the church.
Tech writings are another matter. That is just an enthousiastas, but tech is now so central 
to our lives in so many ways, that there is an awful lot to write about. And I am 
really open to conversations. We are all in flux, forever learning...   

Like 95% of human beings, I am happiest by the sea, but a life of kite-surfing and 
cleaning beaches has so far eluded me.......
