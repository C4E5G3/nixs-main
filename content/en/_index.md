# What's in a name?

The name of this blog relates to my particular appreciation of Nixos, which is nominally a Linux operating system, but
given that it does not use the traditional fhs file system, one could even call it a "post-Linux" operating system. This would be 
fairer at least to newcomers, as the skillset required for Nixos is really very much out of the scope of traditional Linux competences, but on balance,
perhaps it can be called a "second generation" Linux operating system. I don't know - I'll leave to the experts to adjudicate.

The site is a portemanteau - I blog about tech, current affairs, biblical subjects, a pot-pourri of things.......

## Why the tech element?

I am essentially a writer. Films, but also discursively. So why the tech element?
I've always been an afficionado of Linux, having used mainly Fedora since 2008. However things changed about 18 months
ago when my system crashed, (MX as it happens), and so I needed to adopt a new operating system. I initially tried the 
hot new thing, Nixos, but struggled with its complexities, and so I defaulted quickly back to good old Fedora.
Then last summer Fedora changed their open source policy, and so I was forced to move to another mainline distro.
Again I tried Nixos, this time with considerably more success, but I still struggled - actually it was only setting up 
Neovim that temporarily eluded me, whilst I had some irritations with Hyprland. Consequently I flipped back to a mainline distro; 
I road-tested Debian, PopOS, Open Suse, Mint, and Solus, and the one that I most enjoyed was Open Suse, running plasma kde.
(However PopOS is a very popular distro). 

As soon as I solved my Neovim issues, I converted completely back to Nixos. Some people think Nixos is only useable for servers. 
I beg to differ - I really think it is an awesome OS, and I will attempt to explain why over the course of some posts.
You know, our PC is a big part of our environment, especially for a writer like myself, so how you set it up is quite a big deal I think.

Of course, the primary tool for a writer is your word processor. As it happens, I use Fade-In for screenplay writing. It comes in free
& paid versions, but I have found even the free version an extremely elegant piece of software which has aided and enhanced my ability to work.
It is a bit knotty getting it to work on Nixos, so I've queued myself up a blog post I guess.....

Of course, Nixos is not the only game in town; I am slowly getting into programming, so there might be other tech related offerings. There are lots of things to
talk about. (This site is built using Hugo for instance, which is a nice static site builder). But I do believe that Nixos is revolutionary,
akin to the telephone or the television even. It certainly is disruptive, because it posits a whole new operating system paradigm,
one so radical that it has ramifications for containerization and even some of the protocols within devops. Notwithstanding, its greatest impact over the next
five years will probably be server-side.

## Linux in practice 

![](/uploads/photos/lift1.jpg)

I thought I would perorate this home page by addressing the non-Linux user. I have used Windows and Mac operating systems extensively.
2000-2008 Windows, 2009-2021 Mac. From 2008-2021 I simultaneously ran a laptop on Linux, and post 2021, I have been 
all-in Linux. I don't want to talk pejoratively about those other systems. 

### A twelve floor Linux elevator pitch
&nbsp;
1. Security (less prone to violation, more inbuilt security features, and much less hassle to secure*)
2. Stability (less prone to crashes)
3. Customizable (design your own desktop)
4. Configurable (install only what you want, using package managers)
5. Controllable (no recurrent bloatware)
6. Community (people heavily invested in each distro project)
7. Free (it's free, costs nothing! no licence aggro)
8. Open Source (the code is all visible, useable & modifiable)
9. Cheap (runs on minimal hardware)**
10. Privacy oriented (proprietorial operating systems these days are literally tracking devices)
11. Seamless (updates)
12. Optimized Kernel (Linux works with most hardware out of the box)

*My personal bugbear - amongst a sleuth - with Windows was the amount of time spent shoring it up

**You can exhume old hardware and get Linux to run on it, however this is not advisable.
But you can use a minimal modern system (my 8GB DDR Ram set-up cost under 350 Euros)
and have a very good experience. Most Linux systems occupy about 10-20GB of drive space 

***A sleuth (or clowder) is a group of bears - thanks ChatGPT :))

These are not the only areas in which Linux offers advantages, but they are the main ones,
outside of specific use cases. Now unless you have a background in functional programming,
I would not advise trying to jump straight into Nixos, (although it offers both more of the above advantages, and more <ins>than</ins> the above advantages),
much better to cut one's teeth with an established popular distro, e.g. PopOS, Mint, Debian, Ubuntu, Open Suse Tumbleweed
