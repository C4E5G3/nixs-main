## S1.1 Of Tablets & Tableaux&nbsp;  
___

The 66 books of the Bible which serve as an outline of the contents therein nonethless offer very little in the way of clues 
about the themes, structure, and overall narrative flow of the book. Broadly speaking the New Testament is easily apprehended -
accounts of Jesus' life followed primarily by Paul's doctrinal writings, along with the account (implicit in the epistles, explicit in Acts) of the 
embryogenesis of the early church, the whole cryptically perorated with the book of the Revelation. However the Old Testament is
a disparate collection of writings, some literal, some poetic and prophetic, spanning undisclosed historical timeframes leaving us with a 
mighty riddle to unravel. Our mental map of the Old Testament is often anchored in the graphic illustrations that adorn the walls of early school, 
a bearded angry man smashing blocks of stone, the selfsame man parting the sea in two with a raised out staff, a young potentate sitting amongst lions...  
as if that is enough.

## Chapter & Verse ##
&nbsp;   
Out of the box then, the bible does not come with a table of contents, a list of easily digested chapter headings with the kinds of meta descriptions
we are so familiar with these days, all of which might make it that much easier to approach and digest. 
Nehemiah? Who is this man? When did he live? Why was he important? Who was he speaking to? These annotations do exist in certain bible versions
of course, but then they need to be handled judiciously, as they can become a form of interpretation in themselves. (In fact the paragraph headings in most common bibles 
usually add very little, and sometimes add things in a deleterious way, imputing to the text a non-existant theme or subject). The events in the bible 
however are generally not historically pinpointed, and to do so we need to apply either an internal chronological logic, which is possible with certain apocryphal sources
like the Book Of Jubilees and the Books of Maccabbees, or we simply have to delve into the annals of recorded history. In fact in one sense the bible is not an internally 
choate whole, since without external reference points, some elements are not susceptible to exegesis. The most obvious case in point is Matthew 24, which requires a knowledge of history, 
e.g. the works of Josephus, to properly understand and interpret.   

So there you have it, the Bible is inscrutable overall, and deeply inscrutable in parts. Notwithstanding, it comes with a schema, 
you just have to know where to look. 

&nbsp;   


## Still Voices and Distilled Voices ##
&nbsp;   
This is the divine schema, God's own definition of all of biblical history, Israel's history, man's
history, post-Abraham. God gives us the framework for all biblical events, in Genesis 12:

1 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
2 **And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.**

This is the template for the entire bible (minus the pre history, the ante-diluvian era).

1. I will make of thee a great nation 
2. I will bless thee and make thy name great
3. Thou shalt be a blessing
4. I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee
5. In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed


Let's examine these elements one by one. 

&nbsp;   

#### (Act 1) - I will make of thee a great nation 
The primary meaning of the hebrew word 'g√¥y' here is a body of people, and so this is better understood as: "I will make of thee a great people". 
Whilst 'people' clearly overlaps with the notion of a nation, the two are not synonymous, and it is worth bearing in mind that whilst the Israelites have 
been in existence for close to 4000 years, they have inhabited their eponymous nation for less than half that time, around 1410 years to be reasonably 
precise. 

The first narrative act then is the creation of the Israelite people, which we took place between 1877BC to 1448BC, from the covenant with Abraham and the 
sons of Jacob forming the 12 tribes of Israel, down to the multitude of an estimated 1.5 million Hebrews who fled Egypt in 1448BC.

&nbsp; 

#### (Act 2) - I will bless thee and make thy name great
When the Israelites arrived in Sinai, they received the Law, which operated as a binary system of conformity or infraction.
The penalty for egregious violations of the Law was death, which is in effect the most extreme form of exclusion from the camp of Israel. 
There were however other instances where people were legally excluded from the camp, (Deuteronomy 23), but not subject to execution.
The point is one either remained in the Law, and therefore by definition an Israelite, and by definition, blessed, or one 
was excommunicated from Israel. 

At this point, Israel, (that is those people who submitted themselves to the Law), was a blessed people, (one aspect of being blessed was being in possession 
of a nation, hence whilst in bondage in Egypt,{'Act 1'}, the Israelites were not blessed), which was feared by reputation, (as God's people), and which by the time of King Solomon, 
(circa 970-930BC), the apogee of Israel's fame and power, was receiving tribute from all over the world.   

**Exodus 23
25 And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.**

&nbsp; 
   

#### (Act 3) - Thou shalt be a blessing
The idea here is not particularly complex. Christ came out of Israel, being in fact born of the tribe of Judah, and specifically, from the House Of David as promised by God. 
The blessing that Israel bestowed on the world was Jesus Christ, it is as simple as that. It is an idea reiterated by God elsewhere:      
**Genesis 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice**     
And the point is underscored and made unambiguously crystal clear by Paul:    
**Galatians 3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ**

&nbsp; 

#### (Act 4) - I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee

{Note: This oft quoted (and somewhat weaponized) phrase involves two separate Hebrew words, 'arar' and 'qalal'. Thus, 'qalal arar qalal' = 'curse them that curse thee'.
As I am not a Hebrew scholar I cannot conclusively translate this, although whilst the word 'arar' means to curse, the word 'qalal' carries another 
connotation, namely 'despise, dishonour, abase, make despicable, treat with contempt'. So I would understand this phrase literally to mean: 
"I will make despicable with a curse those who dishonour thee."}  


Christ came for his people, Israel. (Therefore, lest there be any confusion, 'the Church' is Israel.) At this point in the biblical narrative,
Israel was severed into two camps, believing Israel and unbelieving Israel. 

**Matthew 10
34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.** 

These camps can also be characterized as New Covenant Israel and Old Covenant Israel.

The entire purpose of Israel was to be 'a nation of priests', i.e. a group of people who ministered to mankind.
In a holistic sense, those who accepted and followed Christ, the Great High Priest, fulfilled this heavenly mandate, and 'blessed Israel'.
Those who rejected Christ and his gospel were rebelling against the divine plan, against a priestly Israel to minister to the world;
in a holistic sense they were 'cursing Israel'.  

In legal terms blessing and cursing are the respective products of obeying and disobeying the Law. Jesus is actually a part of the Law,
which is an important point to understand when trying to parse what he meant about fulfilling the Law. The point is that Jesus is the culmination of
the Law; the law both literally and pedagogically leads to Jesus.

**Deuteronomy 18
18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.**  

So Jesus is the crossroads represented in the Old Testament by Mounts Ebal & Gerizim: choose to be blessed on one hill, or cursed on the other.
Old Covenant Israel at the end of the Law era, when Christ was ministering, had a binary choice: obey the Law and accept Christ, and therefore be blessed,
or reject Christ, thereby repudiating the Law, (but nonethless putting oneself back under the Law, and hence under the curse of the Law), and therefore be cursed.
And so, to sum up, this is what is meant in Genesis 12 - Christ will come out of Israel, and those who accept him (within Israel) will be blessed, 
and those (within Israel) who reject him will be cursed. 
 
&nbsp; 

#### (Act 5) - In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed
The gospel of Christ goes to all the nations and peoples of the world. As with 'Act 3', I think this is a pretty self-evident proposition that needs no
great exegesis. 


Thus the entire biblical narrative is encapsulated in two lines of Genesis.
Now as a caveat, I would observe that the curse on Old Covenant Israel is not a perpetual curse, far from it.
I also realize that there is a lot more to be said about the nature of blessing and cursing, as well as the specifics of the curse upon Old Covenant Israel,
all of which I will come onto in due course.

To make it slightly clearer, we are very familiar with the curse, as Jesus pronounces it repeatedly on the religious leadership shortly prior to his execution:

**Matthew 23:13 
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye 
them that are entering to go in**

But I don't want to get dragged away from showing the general synopsis of events, so I will wrap this article up here for now.
