## S1.2 Defining Terms - Exhibit A 
___
**For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line - Isaiah 28**

One of the most sure ways to engender confusion, other than talking in a foreign language, is when talking in a mutual language, to lend unusual or heteroclite meanings to words. 
Sometimes in life we find ourselves talking at cross-purposes, and that can be occasioned by something as simple as having different understandings of the same word. 
And not just words, concepts also can mean different things to different people. It is far from an exhaustive list, but I will from time to time define biblical terms, 
or even challenge extra-biblical formulations that have become embedded in normative theology.   
&nbsp;
### Exhibit A - Sin
&nbsp;

Sin is a relatively difficult subject. It would be easy to say that sin is a matter of disobeying God, and while this is probably more than enough for us to know, 
after all throughout the bible we are told to obey God’s commands, and in Adam, the prototypical sinner, we see exactly this modality - a strict instruction contravened -
 sin is a bit more complicated I am afraid. 

The thing is, all men are born sinful, and this is because of Adam’s sin. So this begs the question of why am I, or you, or anyone else, responsible for Adam’s mistake? 
Well this is quite a complex matter which Paul discusses in Romans 5. Before we get to that, let’s back up a bit. First of all, let’s be clear on one simple fact. 
At Judgment Day, we are judged solely on our own merits, that is pretty obvious I think, and scripturally well-attested. Now, what about situations where God exercises 
judgment in the temporal sphere? Let’s put some examples forward:

Ananias and Sapphira in the New Testament. Herod. Sodom & Gomorrah. The land of ‘pre-Israel’, Canaan, (inhabited by the Canaanites).
There are lots of examples, so I’ve just evinced a few. Let’s take Sodom & Gomorrah. Abraham & God have a long discussion prior to the destruction of the towns. 
What is the issue at stake? The issue is that of destroying the innocent along with the guilty.  It’s a pretty heavy-duty conversation really when you think about it. 
Abraham asks God if he will destroy the town if there are 50 innocent people in it, and then it ratchets down bit by bit to 5. "If there are 5 innocent people in the town, 
(let’s imagine a town of 50,000 people, for poetic purposes), if there are 5 people in the town God, will you destroy them as collateral damage?"
God: "No". The rest of the story we know well. The angels descend on the town and fish out Lot and his family. But it begs a question, or rather imposes a 
rather uncomfortable truth, viz, that God views all the children of Sodom & Gomorrah, right down to the cradled ones, as guilty of sin, because they are all destroyed.

So clearly there is another vector to sin that has nothing to do with disobedience, and which we know as 'generational sin'. This means something quite hard to fathom, 
that sinfulness (and righteousness) are passed down generationally. This is actually revealed to us throughout the bible. Solomon pays part of the price for King David’s sin. 
Noah’s righteousness covers his whole family. The Moabites were banned from entering the congregation of Israel for 10 generations. God tells Joshua to wipe out the 
Canaanites man, woman and child. (If that sounds harsh, let it be understood that those people were really sick, involved in child immolation and burying children alive, 
for instance, amongst a whole host of really horrible practices). 

Ezekiel tells us, (chapter 14), that Israel is so wicked (circa 6th Century BC) that:

**14 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God.....
16 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered**

Which really underscores the point - the sin of Israel is so egregious that even children normally adjudged as righteous are tainted by it.

Of course these ideas are not extant in the new covenant, (‘the sins of the fathers shall no longer be visited on the sons’), but we see them however manifested in the 
present (2024) actions of the state of Israel and their blanket obliteration of Palestinians, clearly demonstrating an old covenant mindset - or at least paradigm -
in this regard. 

Returning to Adam, Paul tells us that (Romans 5 verse 12):

- **Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned - NIV**
- **Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned - KJV**

It would be easy to read this, (or perhaps some Churches have mistakenly taught it this way), as meaning that we all die because we all sin, which we would construct in English 
something like: "death passes to all men because all men sin" - as if you were not subject to mortality until that moment you stole a 
packet of sweets when you were seven. However, this is not really what is meant here. The Greek tense being used, the aorist active indicative, actually 
militates against this sense. The aorist active indicative refers to a specific one-off event in the past, and so, literally, we could understand: "Death passed, 
(one-off event), to all mankind, because mankind sinned, (one-off event)". And as we read the whole passage, it becomes clearer that this is precisely what Paul means:

**19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous**

The point here is that all mankind are tainted by Adam's sin. Or more precisely, all mankind is held accountable for Adam's sin.
Adam’s sin is a generational sin, and in this instance, it affects all subsequent generations. God has adjudged all generations of Adam, ergo mankind, to be sinful, 
to be generationally sinful because Adam was sinful.   

We could perhaps reflect on why God thinks like this, (my personal feeling is that this is because natural law precedes spiritual law*), but I really wanted here to establish 
the nature of sin, which is critical in understanding blessings and cursings. Don’t worry, we will come full circle to Israel at the end of the Church age,
 which I mentioned as ‘Tabula Rasa’ in my first blog.

*By natural law I just mean the nature of things. Jesus applied natural law as well as spiritual law - 'You reap what you sow'. I.E. things have consequences, something that 
is just hard-wired into the nature of the universe, along with less abstract natural laws like 'men impregnate women to make babies'. You could also think of it this way: 
if someone is murdered when they are twenty, not only are they victim of a heinous crime, but all the susequent generations of family that they might have had are also in a sense 
victim of this one crime.
