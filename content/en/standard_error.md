## Standard Error

**1 Corinthians 5:6** 
**Donâ€™t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?**

This section is devoted to debunking some of the false ideas that permeate Christian thinking. Most of these ideas are niche and 
emanate from the bible & theology colleges and seminaries, however some are embedded in cultural Christianity and are simply
very mainstream Christian beliefs. 

These theological constructs still have enormous reach however, because a surprising number of people study at theological college. 
I have nothing against theological colleges - I applaud and endorse anyone who wishes to study and improve in life, and
walk closer to Jesus. However, a proper bible study curriculum should major in the study of Ancient Greek and Hebrew, 
and also reflect the fact that Jesus himself employed something akin to the Socratic method when teaching. 

I think these corrections that I supply are much more useful than any of my essays.
In line with Sherlock Holmes' deductive rubric, "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, 
must be the truth"; the same principle applies in bible hermeneutics. Eliminate all the theological fausses pistes and general cruft, 
and you will quickly find yourself uncovering the truth.
