##In the Mouth of Two or Three Witnesses - Part 1
Deuteronomy 19:15
Matthew 18:16
2 Corinthians 13:1



One of the most prevalent and powerful rules, a golden rule if you like, throughout 
scripture, is the law of two to three witnesses. This is a legal rubric which mandates that
for anything to be upheld in a court of law, at least two witnesses are required. 
In fact, whilst two witnesses are acceptable, three witnesses is the golden mean,
the Rosetta stone of proof. (I suppose in Israelite courts, two individuals of exemplary character
would suffice; any doubt however and a third witness might be elicited....)

We see this rule at play throughout scripture, but let's now apply it 1 John 5, 
for better exegesis.

John tells us that there are three witnesses of Christ in the earth - Spirit, Water, Blood.

#####1 John 5:8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one

What does he mean exactly?

####Spirit
The Church is the where the Spirit of God resides. In the Old Testament the spirit of God resided in the Temple,
whilst under the new covenant, the spirit resides in all believers. At Pentecost in Acts, the spirit came upon 
the Church. The Church, that is the true Church, the global body of spirit-filled believers, in its
entirety, is the Spirit of God, manifested. Both the corporate Church, and the individual believers therein, 
manifest Christ in the earth.

####Water
Water is a metaphor for the Word. Paul states this in Ephesians 5:26, and Jesus states this in John 4, 
with the Samaritan woman at the well, where he delineates between spirit & truth, equating truth 
with scripture and the Jews, and with water, whereas the Samaritan woman although having spirit, is 
bereft of the truth. This is because the Samaritans had corrupted scriptures loosely based on the Pentateuch - 
a legacy of the apostasy of the Northern Kingdom - whilst the uncontaminated scriptures along with the Levitical 
scribes who preserved them, had all been housed in Jerusalem for centuries). So the water that John refers to in 1 John 5:8 is a reference to scripture: the Bible including the New Testament itself. 

Which brings us to the blood. Who or what is the third witness in the world?

####Blood
The third witness is Old Covenant Israel, the Israel that rejected Christ, and that has walked 
the earth for nearly 2000 years mostly in diaspora. At Christ's trial, the Israelites cried, 
'his blood be upon us'. As this is a deep subject, I will cover it in Part 2 of this post.
But this is what John is referring to here: the part of Israel that rejected Christ, old covenant Israel,
are the blood witness John evokes. 


So to summarize, Christ has had two/three witnesses in the earth for 2000 years.
Now as we know, he does nothing by accident. For many centuries the scriptures were witheld
from the common man. This left just two witnesses: the Church, and the anti-Church, Old Covenant Israel.
(Small wonder Israel, Jews, were so vilified really).  

In part 2 I will try and unpack all this a bit more
