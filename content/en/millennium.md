## The Millennium

The thousand year reign of Christ & his saints referred to in Revelation (Revelation 20:4) is the subject of much theological
....'speculation' shall we say. This engenders three different schools of thought; these camps are referred to as: 
- Amillennial-ism
- Pre-Millennial-ism
- Post-Millennial-ism

They view the thousand year reign, respectively, as 
- a) 'figurative' 
- b) something that happens when Jesus returns 
- c) something that started after the fall of Jerusalem, and which is ongoing.

I will preface my next comment with the observation that Christ's Revelation is essentially, (or at least in significant part), 
the revelation of Christ to the Jews, since old covenant Jews have a veil over their understanding as to who Christ is. 
The revelation is, obviously, the removal of the veil.

The millennium itself is simply the 1000 generation promise of God made to Israel, no more no less. 

**Deuteronomy 5
9 I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of 
those who hate me, 10 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments** 

This promise is made no less than five times in the Old Testament. Clearly this is a very significant matter. Double or even 
single repetition by God is a "take notice" flag. At four repetitions, our ears should be ringing. 

And that is basically the nub of the matter. Yes, we see generations encoded in Revelation as years, which I will explain another 
time when I go deeper on God's time lexicon & time cycles. The main point here is that all these theological polemics have 
completely & egregiously missed the point, engendering tremenduous contention & confusion, whilst demonstrating absolutely 
zero understanding of how God has structured time, the role Israel plays within that time structure, 
and more fundamentally, the nature of God's promises and covenants with Israel.
