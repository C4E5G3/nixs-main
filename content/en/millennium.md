## The Millennium

The thousand year reign of Christ & his saints referred to in Revelation (Revelation 20:4) is the subject of much theological 
speculation. This has engendered three different schools of thought, whose camps are referred to as:
 
- Amillennial
- Pre-Millennial
- Post-Millennial

They view the thousand year reign, respectively, as:
 
- a) 'figurative' 
- b) something that happens when Jesus returns 
- c) something that started after the fall of Jerusalem, and which is ongoing

I will preface my next comment with the observation that The Book Of Revelation, the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ, is essentially, 
(or at least in significant part), the revelation of Jesus to the Jews, since old covenant Jews have a veil over their 
understanding as to who Christ is. The revelation (literally - 'unveiling') is, obviously, the removal of the veil on 
the understanding of the Jews, in order that they can see Jesus' face so to speak, his identity.

The millennium itself is simply the 1000 generation promise that God made to Israel no less than five times in the Old Testament. 
This fact is partially obscured by the encoding of the timeframe, and at some point I will explain how timeframes are 
encoded in the Bible, and how critically important they are. Nevertheless, in this instance, the concealement is extremely
slight - we don't need to be Nicolas Tesla to see the affinity between 1000 years and 1000 generations. 

**Deuteronomy 5
9 I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of 
those who hate me, 10 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments** 

And that is basically the nub of the matter. Something fairly simple and self-evident has been turned into a bone of 
contention which foments denomination, schism, and a lack of real understanding of the truth. In a certain sense it 
imports identity politics into the Church. "I'm a this", "I'm a that"...just as Paul called it 2000 years ago - 1 Corinthians 3.

Aside from engendering endless debates, this contention demonstrates that institutionalized christianity has zero 
understanding of how God has structured time, what role Israel plays within that time structure, and much more egregiously, 
shows that it has no proper idea about the nature of God's promises and covenants with Israel.

It is true that pre-millennarianism is therefore, by default, correct out of the three doctrines, but I have never heard 
this camp properly explain the timeframes and epochs in view. They are simply correct in the way that a multiple choice answer 
can be correct, 'least dirty shirt' as it were. If they could explain the old covenant promises and curses in view, then 
there would be no doctrinal division whatsoever, as everything would then be glaringly obvious. 

...(tbc)...
